                <p>The holiday
                    of Mardi Gras is
                    celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated
                    for
                    about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start of
                    lent
                    in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
                    permitting); many days have several large parades.
                    <br><br>
                    The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the
                    Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding
                    communities,
                    including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls). The parades in New Orleans are
                    organized by
                    social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade schedule and route each year. The
                    earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of
                    Momus
                    and
                    the Krewe of Proteus.
                    <br><br>
                    Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and
                    events
                    (often featuring celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well
                    as
                    the
                    Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders
                    traditionally
                    toss
                    throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons,
                    decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys.
                    <br><br>
                    Major krewes follow the same
                    parade schedule and route each year. While many tourists center their Carnival season activities
                    on
                    Bourbon Street, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route
                    along
                    St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Faubourg Marigny
                    and
                    French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes
                    with
                    the
                    "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.

                    alt="">
                <p>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi
                    River in what is now
                    lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men
                    celebrated it as part of an
                    observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New
                    Orleans
                    is unknown. A 1730
                    account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming
                    (including
                    cross-dressing).
                    An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and
                    wearing of masks in the
                    streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly
                    renewed
                    whenever such
                    restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1833, Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent
                    raised
                    money to fund an
                    official Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other
                    Miscellaneous Pieces
                    describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835.
                    <br><br>
                    Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for
                    fun,
                    frolic, and comic
                    masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men
                    and
                    boys, women and
                    girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear
                    in
                    grotesque, quizzical,
                    diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and
                    birds, beasts and birds
                    with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats
                    from the moon;
                    mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons,
                    carts, coaches, cars,
                    &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming,
                    fiddling, fifeing, and
                    all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.

                <p>Epiphany on January 6, has been recognized as the start of the New Orleans Carnival season since
                    at
                    least 1900; locally,
                    it is sometimes known as Twelfth Night although this term properly refers to Epiphany Eve,
                    January
                    5, the evening of the
                    twelfth day of Christmastide.The Twelfth Night Revelers, New Orleans' second-oldest Krewe, have
                    staged a parade and
                    masked ball on this date since 1870.A number of other groups such as the Phunny Phorty Phellows,
                    La
                    Société Pas Si
                    Secrète Des Champs-Élysées and the Krewe de Jeanne D'Arc have more recently begun to stage
                    events on
                    Epiphany as
                    well.

                    Many of Carnival's oldest societies, such as the Independent Strikers' Society, hold masked
                    balls
                    but no longer parade
                    in public.

                    Mardi Gras season continues through Shrove Tuesday or Fat Tuesday.</p>

                <h3>Days leading up to Mardi Gras Day</h3>
                <p>The population of New Orleans more than doubles during the five days before Mardi Gras Day, in
                    anticipation of the
                    biggest celebration.

                    Wednesday night begins with Druids, and is followed by the Mystic Krewe of Nyx, the newest
                    all-female Krewe. Nyx is
                    famous for their highly decorated purses, and has reached Super Krewe status since their
                    founding in
                    2011. Nyx has
                    plummeted in membership and can no longer hold their self proclaimed status as a super krewe.

                    Thursday night starts off with another all-women's parade featuring the Krewe of Muses. The
                    parade
                    is relatively new,
                    but its membership has tripled since its start in 2001. It is popular for its throws (highly
                    sought-after decorated
                    shoes and other trinkets) and themes poking fun at politicians and celebrities.

                    Friday night is the occasion of the large Krewe of Hermes and satirical Krewe D'État parades,
                    ending
                    with one of the
                    fastest-growing krewes, the Krewe of Morpheus.There are several smaller neighborhood parades
                    like
                    the Krewe of
                    Barkus and the Krewe of OAK.

                    Several daytime parades roll on Saturday (including Krewe of Tucks and Krewe of Isis) and on
                    Sunday
                    (Thoth, Okeanos, and
                    Krewe of Mid-City).

                    The first of the "super krewes," Endymion, parades on Saturday night, with the celebrity-led
                    Bacchus
                    parade on Sunday
                    night.</p>

                <h3>Mardi Gras Day</h3>
                <p>The celebrations begin early on Mardi Gras Day, which can fall on any Tuesday between February 3
                    and
                    March 9 (depending
                    on the date of Easter, and thus of Ash Wednesday).

                    In New Orleans, the Zulu parade rolls first, starting at 8 am on the corner of Jackson and
                    Claiborne
                    and ending at Broad
                    and Orleans, Rex follows Zulu as it turns onto St. Charles following the traditional Uptown
                    route
                    from Napoleon to St.
                    Charles and then to Canal St. Truck parades follow Rex and often have hundreds of floats blowing
                    loud horns, with entire
                    families riding and throwing much more than just the traditional beads and doubloons. Numerous
                    smaller parades and
                    walking clubs also parade around the city. The Jefferson City Buzzards, the Lyons Club, the
                    Irish
                    Channel Corner Club,
                    Pete Fountain's Half Fast Walking Club and the KOE all start early in the day Uptown and make
                    their
                    way to the French
                    Quarter with at least one jazz band. At the other end of the old city, the Society of Saint Anne
                    journeys from the
                    Bywater through Marigny and the French Quarter to meet Rex on Canal Street. The Pair-O-Dice
                    Tumblers
                    rambles from bar to
                    bar in Marigny and the French Quarter from noon to dusk. Various groups of Mardi Gras Indians,
                    divided into uptown and
                    downtown tribes, parade in their finery.

                <h1>The Mayor of New Orleans</h1>
                <img class="float-end ms-3 my-1" style="width:30%" src="images/about/mayor.jpg" alt="">
                <p>LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of
                    New Orleans,
                    Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before
                    becoming mayor, Cantrell
                    represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012-2018.</p>

                <h3>Political career</h3>
                <p> New Orleans City Council
                    In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City Council seat vacated when former
                    District B
                    representative Stacy Head won an election to an at-large position. After the November election,
                    candidate Dana Kaplan
                    and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff, which Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote. Cantrell
                    served out the
                    balance of Head's term, and was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014.

                    As a council member, Cantrell focused on health, housing, and criminal-justice issues. She
                    introduced a bill banning
                    smoking at restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health effects of secondhand smoke on
                    service industry
                    workers. The council unanimously passed the bill in 2015.

                    Also in 2015, Cantrell began work to open a low-barrier homeless shelter, a move that was objected
                    to by residents
                    because of its proposed placement in Central City, New Orleans. Instead, the shelter was moved to
                    the downtown site of
                    the former VA Hospital. In 2017, Cantrell introduced legislation with at-large council member Jason
                    Williams to
                    register and inspect rental units in the city.

                    As a member of the Criminal Justice Committee, Cantrell has participated in efforts to install crime
                    cameras in her
                    district, assess the effectiveness of citywide anti-gun-violence campaigns, and address
                    understaffing at the New Orleans
                    Police Department.</p>

                <h3>2017 mayoral election</h3>
                <p>Main article: 2017 New Orleans mayoral election
                    Cantrell declared her candidacy for mayor of New Orleans in March 2017 in a race to replace
                    term-limited mayor Mitch
                    Landrieu. An open primary was held on October 14 and included 18 candidates. Cantrell garnered the
                    most votes,
                    winning 39% of the total. In the November 18 runoff election, Cantrell defeated fellow Democratic
                    opponent Desiree
                    Charbonnet, a former municipal judge, with 60% of the vote. She is the first woman to lead New
                    Orleans in its 300-year
                    history, as well as the first mayor not born in the city since Vic Schiro.</p>

                <h3>Mayor of New Orleans</h3>
                <p>Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
                    history. Once
                    in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a strategic
                    plan to address
                    families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with
                    finding solutions to
                    violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city
                    use, Cantrell has
                    focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public
                    parks, and green
                    spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against
                    four opioid
                    manufacturers and distributors.

                    During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share Agreement
                    with Governor John
                    Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million in upfront
                    funding for the city's
                    infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring revenue for the city.Following the
                    approval of the
                    Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals Cantrell and the City Council
                    put on the ballot
                    in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term
                    rental properties, as
                    well the establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.</p>

                <h3>Awards</h3>
                <p>In 2016, Cantrell was given a lifetime achievement award by the presidents of Tulane, Loyola and
                    Xavier universities and
                    the University of New Orleans for her service to the community.

                    2021 mayoral election
                    Main article: 2021 New Orleans mayoral election
                    Cantrell was re-elected to office by a wide margin in November 2021, securing 65% of the vote.Her
                    campaign focused
                    on the city's status in 2020 as a COVID-19 hotspot and her efforts, which at times were unpopular,
                    to stop the disease's
                    spread. She also stressed the need for higher-paying jobs for city workers, better public health
                    outcomes and new
                    technologies for the future of New Orleans.</p>
